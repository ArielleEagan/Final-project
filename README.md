Goals - Salary Prediction project answers the question, what salary should you expect in a data scientist role depending on your location, experience and level. Using Machine Learning, the project utilizes neural networks and hyper-parameter tuning to return a total compensation for data scientist role. 

Salary dataset pulled from Levels.fyi

Cleaned, transformed and scaled the data for 6 main features to pass through the neural network to predict total yearly compensation.</br>
Notebooks starting with "Neural Network" builds the three neural network models and saves them</br>
