Goals - Salary Prediction project answers the question, what salary should you expect in a data scientist role depending on your location, experience and level. Using Machine Learning, the project utilizes neural networks and hyper-parameter tuning to return a total compensation for data scientist role. 

Salary dataset pulled from Levels.fyi

Data Cleaning and Exploration is the notebook that cleans the data</br>
Notebooks starting with "Neural Network" builds the three neural network models and saves them</br>

Random Forest is the random forest model for the yearly compensation model</br>
City_Distances  is the notebook that calculates the distances of all cities from the three different cities and saves them to a csv file</br>
Prediction is the notebook that combines all the models and makes the prediction of yearly compensation, bonus and equity for given user inputs</br>
